    We are addressing the issue of a network failure in the case of natural disasters. During these disasters existing communication 
    networks are often among the first pieces of critical infrastructure to fail, leaving individuals disconnected. In these events,
    wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks and other forms of communication are obsolete; making it difficult for rescue teams and those
    affected to communicate. This absence of communication increases the mortality rate, of which we would like to limit. The solution 
    shall be explained later in the description.
